In your IDE type `mkdir practice-repo`\r\n2. Go into it by typing in `cd practice-repo`\r\n3. Type `git init` to initalize the repo\r\n4. Add a new file so type in `touch README.md` to create a starter file\r\n5. Save your file or if you're using Auto Save on your IDE, skip this step\r\n6. Add this file to the stage by typing `git add README.MD`\r\n7. Type in `git commit -m \"your message here\"`\r\n8. On your GitHub account, on the top right click on the \"+\" button and click \"New repository\"\r\n9. Fillout the repository information and makre sure that **both repos on your IDE and on Github both have the same name**\r\n10. Then click \"Create repository\"\r\n11. Now type in your IDE\r\n12. \r\n    `git remote add origin git@github.com:(your username)/practice-repo`\r\n    \r\n    `git push -u origin master`\r\n    \r\n9. Then finally just type in `git push` and all your changes to your repo will be \"pushed\" to your remote\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\nThe workflow is save, add, commit, push\r\n\r\n`git add` adds your file to the Git stage, which means that your file is ready to be committed. You type in `git add \"your file name\"`\r\n\r\n`git commit` is when Git takes the snapchat of what is on the stage. Also you are aloud to add a message to your commit to help you describe what you changed to your file in this commit, the way you type it in to your IDE is `git commit -m \"whatever your commit message is\"`\r\n\r\n`git push` is the last part of the Workflow, this is where you are \"pushing\" your changes to the cloud, which is GitHub. The way you type it in is just `git push` and you will see all your changes being pushed up to Github.\r\n\r\n##Note:\r\n\r\nThroughout this work flow it is a good idea to use the command `git status` in between each step.\r\n\r\n`git status` is a command that helps you keep track of whats going on. What I mean by this is it helps you know whats being added to the stage, or what is being committed, or what file hasn't been changed. It is an important part of the workflow as it helps you know whats going on and keeps you up to date and on top of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
