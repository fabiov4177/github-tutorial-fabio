## Git vs. GitHub
**Git:**

- Git is a version control system, what this means is that it keeps "snapshots" of code
- Git is an amazing way to manage your code, every developer uses it
- HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, SQL, Python, Java, Swift, Arduino all stored on Git 
- Git does not require the use of GitHub

**Github:**

- Github is the cloud, or place where the code is stored
- You can see the changes you have made and keep track of them
- It is easy to work with other people on GitHub, and you can collabrate on files
- Github requires the use of Git
